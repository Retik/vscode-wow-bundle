- [**languages.lua**] No longer differenciate Blizzard's Lua extensions like `strsplit()` or `wipe()` from core Lua functions, they all show up as **support.function.lua**.

## 1.0.4
- [**language.lua**] Finally found a way to differenciate quoted constants like functions parameters, event names, script handlers... from strings.

- [**language.lua**] Added some 7.0.3 identifiers, many are still missing though.

- **Updated** `Readme.md`.

## 1.0.1
- [**theme**] Stop recolorizing the default Lua language constructs, you'll really get Dark+ colors for these.
